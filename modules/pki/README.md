The PKI module uses both the acm-pca and cloud-hsm modules to generate, store, manage and use the keys and certificates for the Hyperledger Fabric components. If you want to use a CA other than ACM-PCA or a HSM service other than CloudHSM you should not use this module. You can only use the acm-pca module with another HSM or you can only use the cloud-hsm module with another CA or create your own pki module with a CA and HSM service of your choice.
